        <h3>WINTER</h3>
        <img src="https://wallpapercave.com/wp/T78w0sL.jpg" width="600px;" height="200px;">
          <p>The Winter season in India begins during mid-November in northern India and stays till February. 
            The average lowest temperature of this season is 12°— 15°C. But in hilly regions, the temperature sometimes falls below 0°C. 
            The sunshine is, however, very pleasant. Nature wears a dull look in winter. The trees shed their leaves, and look dull. 
            The air is full of fog and the sun looks pale. The whole of nature is as lifeless as an old man. Winter is a painful season for 
            the poor who cannot buy warm clothes. Delicious vegetables like beans, tomatoes, cauliflowers, cabbages, turnips, etc. are marketed in the season.</p>
